# QuadMind â€“ AI-Assisted Mesh Generation

QuadMind is an experimental project exploring the use of **machine learning** to assist in generating **unstructured finite element meshes**.  

As a starting point, [Karl Levikâ€™s Q-Morph algorithm](https://github.com/KarlLevik/qmorph) has been ported from Java to modern **C++20**, with ongoing work on debugging, extending functionality, and preparing the mesh data for AI/ML pipelines.

---

## âœ¨ Features (current & planned)
- âœ… Port of Q-Morph core algorithm from Java â†’ C++20  
- ðŸ”„ Unit tests and validation against the original Java implementation  
- ðŸ“Š Designed to generate datasets for AI/ML mesh quality analysis  
- ðŸš€ Planned: support for surface meshing (NURBS, CAD) and 3D extension  

---

## ðŸ”§ Build Instructions
This project uses **CMake** (with optional [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) integration).  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RCL-Consulting/QuadMind.git
cd QuadMind
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
